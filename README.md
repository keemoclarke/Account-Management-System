# Account-Management-System
This was a project given in one of my classes at Rutgers University. I was asked to create an Account management system that allows the user to manage a stock account and a bank portfolio. 

A quick overview of what this program does:

Stock account:

- Display current price for a stock symbol
- Buy stock
- Sell stock
- Display current portfolio
- Display transactions history
- Return to main menu


Bank account:
- Display current cash balance
- Deposit to account
- Withdraw from account
- Display transactions history
- Return to main menu



See the file "PM1_Project2Instructions.pdf" for full details of what was asked of students.
